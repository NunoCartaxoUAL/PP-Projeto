# Bus Management System Simulation
This project was done as part of a university module on programming paradigms. The project aimed to teach us how to use threads and deal with the problems caused by memory sharing. We used OOP concepts to create a bus management system simulation.

## Project Description
The simulation had a simple GUI consisted of 4 different types of buses picking up passengers in 5 locations until the simulation's locations had no more passangers. The simulation was simple, but it allowed us to practice programming paradigms and concurrency int threads.

## What We Learned
Throughout this project, we gained hands-on experience with programming paradigms, specifically using threads and dealing with memory sharing. We learned how to implement OOP concepts into a program, allowing us to create a bus management system simulation that was easy to maintain and modify. We also learned how to debug a program that uses threads.

While the project achieved its intended learning goals, there are some limitations due to the scope of the project. The simulation was simple and only covered basic bus management scenarios.
